# LearnMoore Coding Interview

Thank you for showing interest in joining our lab! Before we move forward, we want to make sure you have some of the necessary coding skills to help with our work. This assesement is split into four parts:

## 1) Parsing data (~5 min)
* **(Coding)** We will give you a  JSONL file and have you first parse it and then turn it into a CSV for downstream analysis.

## 2) Experimental design (~5 min)
* **(Discussion)** We will describe how we collected some data. Think of some issues that may come up and how we should pre-process the data before analysis.

## 3) Data analysis (~5 min)
* **(Coding)** We want to see your curiosity shine. We will provide you with a cleaned up and formatted CSV file. Analyze the data and think of a way to present a certain pattern as a figure. We suggest that you start off only looking over a certain question set or model before looking at data in the agregate.

## 4) Drawing conclusions (~5 min)
* **(Discussion)** Show us how you think. We'll give you a few figures that we have generated from our data. Talk us through what you find most interesting and what you would want to investigate further.


We encourage you to use AI assistance during this assesment (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude Code, etc.). Given the short time frame alotted, we don't expect all code to run perfectly. It's okay if you run into a few bugs. We care more about how you are thinking through each part rather than your code running perfectly.
